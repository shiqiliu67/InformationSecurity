RSA Public-Key Encryption and Signature Lab Report 1. Introduction
RSA (RivestShamirAdleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure communication. The RSA algorithm first generates two large random prime numbers, and then use them to generate public and private key pairs, which can be used to do encryption, decryption, digital signature generation, and digital signature verification. The RSA algorithm is built upon number theories, and it can be quite easily implemented with the support of libraries. Essentially, students will be implementing the RSA algorithm using the C program language.
The lab covers the following security-related topics: • Public-key cryptography
• The RSA algorithm and key generation
• Big number calculation
• Encryption and Decryption using RSA
• Digital signature
• X.509 certificate
Lab environment: This lab requires the openssl library. I am using Ubuntu 16.04,
which is already installed on.
